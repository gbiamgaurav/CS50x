## Tips

* Tideman was the most challenging problem set in CS50 thus far. It took me a long time to understand.
* Although the codes we need to write are very short, it is not really easy to set up the algorithms. 
* Add some printf functions to see candidates votes, whether candidates eliminated or not etc.
* Test code yourself with different examples. For some cases, check50 does not find some errors!
